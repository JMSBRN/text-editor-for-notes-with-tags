Test task Front-end.

Develop a single page application in React.js (SPA): a text editor for notes with tags.

Functional:
1. Creating, editing, deleting notes;
2. View the list of notes;
3. While creating and editing a note, the user can create tags using the # symbol (For example, the user enters the text “I wanna go to #shop tomorrow”. As they type, the corresponding tag should be created and displayed in the list below the text field. When editing the note, all words corresponding to the tags should be highlighted, i.e. “I wanna go to #shop tomorrow”);
4. Filter notes by tag - the user should be able to select one or more tags from the existing ones and filter the list of notes by them;
5. When reloading the page, notes should be saved (For example, stored in IndexedDb).

Technical requirements:
1. React.js hooks
2. Using TypeScript;
3. Using UI libraries (For example, Material UI, Ant design);
4. Use a state manager (For example, Redux, MobX, etc.);
5. Upload to git (Public repository);
6. Upload to the host (Netlify, Github pages, etc.).
